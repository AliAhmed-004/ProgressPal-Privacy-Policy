    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> May 8, 2025</p>
    <p>
      <strong>SpudByte</strong> built the ProgressPal app as an offline
      productivity tool. This app is provided by us and is intended for use as
      is.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>
      ProgressPal does not collect personally identifiable information from
      users.
    </p>
    <p>However, certain features may involve temporary data processing:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>AI Goal Generation</strong>: If you use this feature, the app
        sends your entered Track and Goal names to an external AI service to
        generate suggestions. This data is:
        <ul>
          <li>Not linked to your identity</li>
          <li>Not stored by us</li>
          <li>Not used for tracking or analytics</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We do not collect, store, or share any personal data from your device.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Permissions</h2>
    <p>The app requests the following permission:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Notifications: To remind you to complete your goals. Notifications are
        optional and controlled by your device settings.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Safety</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>No account is required to use the app.</li>
      <li>All user progress is stored locally on your device.</li>
      <li>We do not use third-party analytics or advertising SDKs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      The app uses external services only for optional AI-powered goal
      generation. These services may process the text you input, but are not
      used for tracking.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Security</h2>
    <p>
      We value your trust. Although no personal information is collected, we
      strive to ensure any temporary data is handled securely.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Childrenâ€™s Privacy</h2>
    <p>ProgressPal does not knowingly collect data from children under 13.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this policy. Any changes will be posted here and take effect
      immediately.
